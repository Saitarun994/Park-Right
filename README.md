# Parking-space-Identifier-segmenter
Automated computer vision system to identify legal and unmarked parking spaces on the side of Indian roads. Indian roads do not have marked parking spaces on every road but most roads have legal parking spaces which the driver must identify by himself. I developed an automated parking spaces identification system for Kriti Labs
